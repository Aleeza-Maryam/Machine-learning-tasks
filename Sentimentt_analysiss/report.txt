Report: Sentiment Analysis of Movie Reviews
Approach

The goal of this task was to classify IMDb movie reviews as positive or negative using machine learning. I followed these steps:

Data Preprocessing

Loaded the IMDb dataset containing 50,000 labeled reviews.

Performed text cleaning: lowercasing, removing punctuation, numbers, and stopwords.

Applied tokenization and converted reviews into numerical features using TF-IDF vectorization.

Model Training

Trained three machine learning models: Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes, and SVM.

Used an 80-20 train-test split.

Tuned hyperparameters where necessary for better performance.

Evaluation

Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Logistic Regression and SVM performed the best, with accuracy around 88–90%.

Naïve Bayes was faster but slightly less accurate.

Optional Extension

Implemented a small interface (command-line based) to input a custom review and get its predicted sentiment.

Challenges Faced

Handling imbalanced words and noisy text (e.g., slang, emojis, mixed casing).

Deciding between Bag-of-Words and TF-IDF representations. TF-IDF performed better in capturing word importance.

Ensuring models generalize well without overfitting.

Key Learnings

Text preprocessing is crucial for achieving good performance in NLP tasks.

Logistic Regression and SVM are highly effective for text classification.

F1-score is a better metric than accuracy when evaluating models with potential class imbalance.

Building a simple interactive interface makes the model more practical and user-friendly.
